# RLlib

C++ library for reinforcement learning

# Installation

The library consists of header files only. So you can put them somewhere your compiler can access them, and it is ok. Nevertheless, a cleaner install can be done as follows with cmake.

<pre>
cd <your_path_here>/RLlib
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
sudo make install
</pre>
