MANUAL INSTALLATION
===================

Since version 2.04.00, the rl is reduced to a set of C++ header files. It can thus be installed very easily manually.

First, install the GSL (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) on your system. You have to know the compiling and linking flags for it. Second, put all the src/*.h files in some directory, where they are available for C++ compiling. You will have to add this directory in the compiling flags.

You should now be able to compile the examples/example-*.cc examples and execute them.


CMAKE INSTALLATION
==================

We provide here the basic installation scheme, more detail can be foud in cmake documentation. You must have installed the gsl-library, with its header files, as well as standard tools for compiling (g++, cmake, ...) and doxygen.


UNIX INSTALLATION
-----------------


For a 32bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr 
make install

For a 64bit architecture, as root, go in this directory, and type

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DLIB_SUFFIX=64
make install

pkg-config is available for compiling your code

g++ -c example.cc `pkg-config --cflags rl`
g++ -o example.bin example.cc `pkg-config --libs rl`


MAC OS INSTALLATION
-------------------

Dependencies :
You can use MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/) or any other means to install the following dependencies :
    - the GSL development files (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
    - CMake (http://www.cmake.org/)
    - (optional) Doxygen

With macports, just type :

sudo port install gsl-devel cmake doxygen

Try the following. 

cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr 
sudo make install

If you have linking problems with gsl, you may fix them by modifying some lines in CMakeLists.txt

Edit this file, and in the section "Get required and optional
library", comment the block concerning pkg-config and uncomment the
one for gsl-config.

then run again
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr 
sudo make install


WINDOWS INSTALLATION
--------------------

As rl is based on the GNU Scientific Library, you need to have the GNU environment available on your system. To do so, install mingw and msys from
http://www.mingw.org/
(the setup package installs both). Select all items when prompted.

In a "cmd", start "bash" in order to have the bash command interpreter running. You may have to fix PATH problems before.

Be sure that pkg-config, cmake and doxygen run properly, or install them from sources from the current bash. Install the GSL from sources as well, since windows packages may not fit all requirements.

Last, follow the instruction in the "UNIX INSTALLATION".
